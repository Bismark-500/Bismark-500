## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m Bismark Awuni

ðŸŽ“ A third-year Statistics student at KNUST with a passion for data science, machine learning, and impactful research.

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™ve worked on multiple applied data science projects through WorldQuant University, using Python, SQL, MongoDB, and machine learning models for real-world insights.

ðŸ“Š Skilled in Python, R, Tableau, STATA, and Excel. I enjoy turning raw data into stories that inform decisions.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently exploring the intersection of data science and finance, especially applying machine learning beyond stock prediction.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning more about stochastic processes, time series forecasting, and deploying ML models.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects or research that involve data analysis, social good, or financial modeling.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about statistics, data visualization, student research projects, or anything Python!
